Here is a copy of the Netfilterqueue project from https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue.git repository in case it would be unavailable in the future.

This can be needed if you has issues when trying to install Netfilterqueue on Kali Linux (or maybe also other Linux systems) with pip or pip3 or "apt install" etc...

Extract the archive,

cd python-netfilterqueue

python3 setup.py install
