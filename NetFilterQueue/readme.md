Here is a copy of the Netfilterqueue project from https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue.git repository in case it would be unavailable in the future.

This can be needed as an alternative way of installing Netfilterqueue if you have issues when trying to install it on Kali Linux (or maybe also other Linux systems) with pip or pip3 or "apt install" etc...

Extract the archive,

cd python-netfilterqueue

python3 setup.py install
